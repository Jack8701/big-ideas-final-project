    "## Introduction\n",
    "Defining the \"best\" neighborhood in Pittsburgh is a very subjective process. To help eliminate some of the human bias, an analytical approach can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "We used three sub-metrics to help determine this, quality of life, assaults, and housing-economics.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this, we needed various data sets:\n",
    "* Quality of Life: Neighborhoods with SNAP data\n",
    "* Assaults: 911 EMS Dispatches and Population by Municipality\n",
    "* Housing-Economics:\n",

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "* Jack Carluccio - Given that I do not live in Pittsburgh, I do not have a solid opinion on the best neighborhood. However, I would pick downtown Pittsburgh, because I love the city. Although, my metric of quality of life would directly punish downtown, because it uses population density as a bad metric."
